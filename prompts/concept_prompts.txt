# Concept Generation Prompts

## Initial Concept Development

### Prompt 1: Game Genre & Mechanics
```
Based on the guidance document "chidan.md", design a hidden role social deduction game about fighting misinformation. The game should:
- Have 3-5 players with asymmetric roles (Moderators vs Clickbait traitor)
- Use a feed-style card system mimicking social media
- Track Viral Meter (lose condition) and Trust Meter (community health)
- Include Fact-Checker support role with limited tokens
- Feature 6 rounds with event cards that modify gameplay
- Educational focus on recognizing misinformation signals
```

### Prompt 2: Educational Integration
```
How can we integrate educational content about misinformation into engaging gameplay?
- 6 red flag signals (sensational headlines, no sources, emotional manipulation, etc.)
- Real Vietnamese context (health myths, digital scams, climate disinfo)
- Balance between fun gameplay and learning objectives
- Post-game reflection on "What did you learn?"
```

### Prompt 3: Visual Style & UI
```
Design a modern, beautiful UI for a browser-based card game about misinformation:
- Feed layout similar to Instagram/Facebook (familiar to users)
- Color coding for roles (green=Moderator, blue=Fact-Checker, red=Clickbait)
- Dual meter system with animated fills
- Modal-based action selection
- Mobile-responsive grid layout
```

## Game Mechanics Refinement

### Prompt 4: Role Asymmetry
```
Design 3 asymmetric roles for a social deduction game:
1. Moderator (2-4 players) - Flag bonus, team player
2. Fact-Checker (0-1 player) - Limited tokens, reveals credibility
3. Clickbait (1 player) - Secret virality boost, 1x block ability

Ensure each role feels unique but balanced. Clickbait should have tools to win solo against the team.
```

### Prompt 5: Card Design System
```
Create a data structure for 25 misinformation cards with:
- Credibility score (0-100)
- Type (false, misleading, true, satire)
- Base virality (1-3)
- Red flag signals array (which of the 6 signals apply)
- Reveal text (educational explanation)
- Action hint (what players should do)
- Source hint (how to verify)

Focus on Vietnamese context and diverse topics.
```

### Prompt 6: Event Cards System
```
Design 10 event cards that modify gameplay each round:
- Positive events (Media Literacy Week -1 virality)
- Negative events (Rumor Storm +1 virality)
- Conditional events (Algorithm prioritizes local news)
- Disruptive events (Internet outage blocks fact-checking)

Events should create dynamic, unpredictable gameplay while staying thematic.
```

## Content Generation

### Prompt 7: Vietnamese Misinformation Examples
```
Generate 20 realistic Vietnamese misinformation headlines covering:
- Health (miracle cures, vaccine myths)
- Climate/Environment (misleading photos, false data)
- Digital scams (fake apps, phishing)
- Technology conspiracies (5G, microchips)
- Consumer issues (scam products)

Each should be recognizable but educational. Include credibility analysis.
```

### Prompt 8: How to Play Instructions
```
Write clear, concise game instructions for:
- Setup (player count, difficulty, role reveal)
- Turn structure (draw event → draw cards → players act)
- Actions (Share, Flag, Check with consequences)
- Win conditions (Clickbait vs Team)
- Scoring system

Should be understandable by ages 14+ without prior gaming experience.
```

## Technical Specifications

### Prompt 9: State Management
```
Design a game state object for a 6-round card game with:
- Player tracking (roles, scores, current turn)
- Deck management (cards, used pile, shuffle)
- Meter tracking (viral, trust)
- Event system (deck, current event, effects)
- Action history log
- Screen navigation (menu, role reveal, play, results)
```

### Prompt 10: AI Player Logic
```
Implement simple but believable AI for 3 roles:
- Moderator AI: 70% flag suspicious cards, 30% share
- Fact-Checker AI: Use tokens on unchecked cards, flag when no tokens
- Clickbait AI: Share low credibility cards, pretend to be team player

Should feel natural without complex ML.
```

## Iteration & Refinement

### Prompt 11: Difficulty Balancing
```
Balance 3 difficulty levels:
- Easy: Higher viral threshold (18), more tokens (4)
- Medium: Standard threshold (15), standard tokens (3)
- Hard: Lower threshold (12), same tokens (3)

Test if Clickbait can realistically win in each mode.
```

### Prompt 12: Educational Outcomes
```
Ensure game teaches:
1. Pause before sharing
2. Check sources and credibility
3. Recognize emotional manipulation
4. Use fact-checking tools
5. Consider context (old photos, missing data)
6. Report misinformation

Integrate naturally into gameplay, not lecturing.
