- Natural replay value for skill improvement

### 2.2 Game Theme Integration

**Viral Meter Mechanics:**
- Simulates how misinformation spreads exponentially on social platforms
- Players experience real pressure of viral content threshold
- Teaches consequences of sharing without verification

**Hidden Role System:**
- Mirrors real social media where bad actors blend in
- Encourages critical thinking: "Who can I trust?"
- Reflects reality: Not everyone spreading fake news is malicious (some are misled)

**Fact-Checking Mechanic:**
- Limited tokens = Limited attention/time in real life
- Must prioritize what to verify
- Teaches strategic information consumption

- Strategy: Verify ambiguous cards, debunk early

**üî¥ Clickbait (Team Evil - Traitor):**
- Goal: Push Viral Meter ‚â• threshold
- Special: +2 points for sharing fake news
- Strategy: Blend in by sharing some true news, strike when team trusts you

**Key Design:**
- ALL roles can use ALL 3 actions (Share/Flag/Check)
- Difference is in BUFFS, not restrictions
- Encourages deception and strategic thinking

### 5.3 Actions

**üì¢ Share:**
- Effect: Increases Viral Meter by card's virality score (üî•1-4)
- When: Only share verified true news (unless you're Clickbait!)
- Risk: High if card is fake news

**üö© Flag:**
- Effect: 
  - Correct flag (fake news): -1 Viral Meter, +1 Trust, +3 points (Moderator: -2 Viral)
  - Wrong flag (true news): -1 Trust, 0 points
- When: Clear indicators of fake news (all caps, extreme claims)
- Risk: Hurts team trust if wrong

**‚úÖ Check (Fact-Check):**
- Cost: 1 token (3 tokens per game), Fact-Checker: FREE
- Effect: Reveals credibility %, debunks fake news for -2 virality
- When: Ambiguous cards, high-virality unknowns
- Risk: Wastes limited resource if used on obvious cards

### 5.4 Victory Conditions

**Team Good Wins:**
- Viral Meter < 15 (Medium difficulty) after 6 rounds
- Demonstrates community successfully protected against misinformation

**Team Evil Wins:**
- Viral Meter ‚â• 15 at ANY point
- Game ends immediately
- Demonstrates misinformation crisis reached tipping point

2. **MISLEADING (7 cards)** - Partially true but missing context, 30-60% credibility
3. **TRUE (5 cards)** - Accurate information, 70-100% credibility
4. **SATIRE (2 cards)** - Obvious jokes, 50% neutral credibility

### 5.6 Random Events (10 types)

Each round draws 1 event that affects gameplay:
- "Viral Storm" - All cards +1 virality
- "Media Literacy Week" - Flag bonuses doubled
- "Network Outage" - Cannot use Check action this round
- "KOL Shares" - Shared cards this round have 2x virality
- Etc.

**Design Purpose:**
- Adds replayability (each game feels different)
